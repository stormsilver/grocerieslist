* need to assign "ui ID" to each item, so that it can be referenced in the drag and drop
  -- this is a unique identifier that is not the same as the database ID
  -- can assign this in API.js
* list page:
  * search bar
* dragging and scrolling is slow, should be fast???
* edit item name
* empty drop zones when there are no items
* add new store
* add new item
* delete item
* delete store
* collapsible sections
* auto switch to dark mode
* rename store? (requires setup section)
* dirty tracking on edited things
* style drag overlay better
  - opaque background
  - big drop shadow
